BSRC is not really a high quality web and computer video game content advisor the entire thing is a joke done by 
the authors of the jupiter homepage.  We hope that we have not confused anyone as to the content of this page
if you ever see a page rated by the BSRC I would recommend that you do not jump to a conclusion about its rating.
We would still appreciate it if you emailed us about it.
