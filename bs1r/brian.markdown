## Brian Thalman
### VIP
"So I crashed into a parked car, so what"

Brian is not really important at all to Beem I (a Beem employee I won’t tell who) just like writing Bio’s.

Brian is the man who got Craig started on programming who ultimately got our president started.

Brain like Craig no longer touches the keyboard, but rather the electric guitar as the lead singer of October.  A band you probably never heard of and most likely never will.

A major influence to our President he taught Blaine to live a life violent free.  Sadly Blaine would never drop the violence Thalman wished him to leave behind.
