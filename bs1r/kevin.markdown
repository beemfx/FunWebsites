## Kevin Decker
### Vice President
"Under Pressure" - Queen&trade; and David Bowie&trade;

Kevin Decker was born to two loving parents.  Each of which has had sex at least seven times we can tell by his huge family of seven children.  Though probably hundreds of more times.  It just happens that only seven of those times pregnancy occurred.

Kevin was the first employee to join the Beem team and truly the most important.  While Blaine is the head of the company Kevin is truly the one responsible for the success.  He is responsible to keep the employees on task.  And sadly the one to fire them when necessary.

Kevin has been described as a womanizer by his friends.  His real friends would disagree as they know he is in fact a virgin.

Though he is not fully versed in software development, his managerial skills are his true gift.  Forbesâ„¢ Magazine voted him top Business Manager of a Software Company 1999.

Among business management he also enjoys quality classical music.  A formidable member of the B.S.A. and V.O.A.  his friends would claim him as a geek.  Maybe his is, but then in our own special way maybe we all are.
