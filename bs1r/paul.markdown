## Paul Everett
### Programmer
"If you take the square root of 1 minus 'v' squared over 's' squared..."

Paul was born in Brooklyn New York in the one thousands seventy first year of our lord and savior.  He graduated from MIT in 1985 with a Masters degree in Theoretical Physics as well as a Doctorate’s in Technical Engineering he also has a degree in Software Engineering, as well as…

Growing up he was known as a joker.  One who would never become anything more than a clown.  Depressed most of his life he showed those who didn’t believe in him by graduating at the top of his class from a prestigious university.

His past, full of hatred, drove him insane.  He spent three years at St. Judith’s Psychiatric Hospital for the mentally ill.  Now doctors say he is fully mentally stable.  We are proud to have him as a member of Beem Software™.

During his time off he enjoys sky diving as well as the comfort of the Jet Ski.

A man in desperate need for love we hope one day he will find the woman he needs.
