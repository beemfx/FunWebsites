We don’t really know who Kyle Stewart is and we never will, unless he happens to read this and e-mail us.

So why is this seemingly nobody important.  I’ll tell you.  This is the man who started Brian on programming, who would start Craig, who started Blaine our President.

Kyle might enjoy skateboarding.  Maybe bicycling.  We don’t really know.  But we do care.  Because we are caring people.
