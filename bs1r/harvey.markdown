## Harvey Donothan
### Artist
"The colors I see speak to me"

Harvey studied the fine arts for years at Wellington’s Academy of the fine arts.  His parents wished him to following in their footsteps as Royalty of Manchua a small European country.  He had larger dreams.  Those of a struggling artist.

His art  has been exclaimed as “Extraodanaire”, “A Vision of Depth and Passion”, and “Seeing makes life worth living”. 

His study of art has consumed most of his life.  He has had very little time to do anything but else.  A closed life, one could say, maybe it’s true.  But to see his art is to say it is worth a closed life.

He is not completely limited to art.  His mind also spills out words of the most passionate poetry.  The employees of Beem love to hear his kind words.  It brings a spirit to their souls they never felt before.
