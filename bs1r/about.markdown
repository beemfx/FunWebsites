## A History of Beem Software
Beem Software was started in 1997 under the name of B.M. Software. Almost as soon as the company was started we developed Castle version 1.00 which would advance to castle 1.4 in the subsequent months. At that point we continued our software development with Joes Copter. Following the success of Joes Copter we began development of it's sequel Joes Copter 2: The Revenge, as well as the popular title Explor: A New World.

Joes Copter 2 beta hit the market big with a good look for the future. However, sadly, most of our development team quit. We were forced to shut down the project, permanently. Almost all functions of Beem were put off for years.

Then in November of 1999 B.M. was back on it's feet. Financially anyway. We upgraded most of our lab's and equipment. Within a few months we continued the development of our trashed project Explor. We developed an entirely new system for our company and were pouring out titles by the year. Explor Beta was completed in the first quarter of 2000. The public loved it. B.M. was ready for the future.

Sadly in the last quarter of 2000 B.M. was facing a lawsuit by another company owning the rights to the name B.M. Software. The size of the suit was so large we were going to have to shut down completely. After spending thousands of dollars and months in court we reached a settlement. We'd have to give up a lot. After several more months of ensuing struggle we were able to get back onto our feet. We changed our name to the now nationwide known Beem Software.

With the law suit over with and our new name we began to further our developments. After hundreds of man-hours we finally released Castle: A Text Based Adventure version 3.00. With the all new technology Castle hit the market big. With popularity from ages young to old.

Beem has continued it's project development with plans to complete Explor: A New World. Beem hopes to continue to develop great new software titles into the 21st Century.
