### President
"Get back on the \*\*\*king schedule"

Beloved president and founder of Beem Software.  Our employees claim that without him nothing would ever happen.  Enraged constantly most the employees hearts fear him in their entirety. 

While originally Beem was a one man show, now any visitors will be lucky to catch a glimpse of this head honcho.  He is constantly locked in his office where he live an unknown life. 

Itâ€™s been said that our president loves the outdoors and as a child would constantly live his life on the mystical trampoline. 

Now as an adult he enjoys the quiet life of writing.  And has several screenplays, short stories, and plays published.  Even now he is working on a novel.  Poetry has always been on of his passions, and for years he has put out heart felt words of passion.

It is known that he is a man of unlimited talent.  Including the fine arts as well as science and mathematics.  It was said his future would be unlimited in possibility and he has certainly shown that it is.

A bodybuilder, Blaine has been voted sexiest man of the year by TIME&trade; Magazine.
