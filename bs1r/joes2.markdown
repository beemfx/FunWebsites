### Story:
“I can’t shake him,” Joe screamed through the com.  A mysterious vehicle had appeared behind him and was hot on his trail.  Joe didn’t know why it was there, but he did no this.  If he couldn’t get away he’d be dead.

Machine gun fire poured out from behind.  “I’ve got you know,” a deep voice came over Joe’s headset.

“Who are you?”  It was two late a Joe’s equipment showed an AVOK missile coming up from right behind.  Joe braced himself for the impact.

BASH.  Joe’s head bounced forward.  Smoke filled the small cockpit.  He saw the grown hurdling towards him.  And then in a swift moment it was over.  Smoke poured up from a flame drenched pile of metal.

But Joe was not gone.  He had left behind a jewel.  A jewel that would let him live one.
