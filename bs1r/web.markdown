We at Beem have been a fan of the popular Might and Magic Titles for years and for that reason we developed a site dedicated to each title in the series.

<div class="bs1-web-title">The Semi-Official Titanic Page</div>
We at Beem are not ashamed to admit that we are fans of James Cameron's Academy Award Winning Film Titanic and for that purpose we have a site dedicated to this amazing movie.

**Note:** This site has gone out of commission.

<div class="bs1-web-title">Official Jupiter Web Site</div>
The first of Beem's web sites and certainly the most popular. We have disbanded this site now and no longer support it.  It is merely a free floating pile of information among the damnations of the internet. We no longer consider it property of Beem. Interested in gaining the rights to it? E-mail us.
