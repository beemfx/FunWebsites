## Jovas Martinez
### Music
"Let the music speak for you."

Jovas is the excitement, happiness, joy, sadness, depression, and pain of Beem Software.

His music has inspired millions.  Both lifting and destroying spirits.  To hear what he has to offer is to hear anything worth hearing.  Some would say he has a sour heart.  Others would claim if you were to die without hearing his music you never lived.

We are proud to have him hear at Beem.  Heâ€™s done soundtracks for over a dozen films.  And now he works to bring beautiful music to computer entertainment.  Every note he writes is perfect.  We are always amazed by what he can do with a sheet of music.

Born in France in 1962, the years have taught him well.  He speaks more than a dozen languages.  An knows even more styles of music.  From depressing tunes to upbeat rhythm Jovas has done it all.

His parents died when he was very young.  Music was his way to honor them.  To hear it truly is to honor them.
