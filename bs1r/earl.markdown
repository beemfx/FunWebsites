## Earl Sanchez
### Programmer
"What the hell does Dxf(x)=f'(x) mean?"

Earl Sanchez was born in Mahonri, Peru.  A village of very little importance.  In fact it doesn’t even appear on any maps at all.  Earl grew up with knowledge only of the sport of basketball.

At the age of eleven years Earl’s father brought him to the life of freedom in America.  It was soon discovered that America did not provide a life of freedom.  Rather it gave the opportunity to find freedom.

Ten years later he, now aged twenty one, discovered himself on the streets of New York.  Out of a miracle from Heaven our president Blaine passed by as he lay out in street.  Blaine of much compassion offered Earl a job.

Though at first Earl was completely incapable of anything in the computing world.  It was soon discovered he had a unique understanding of binary formulas.  Though he knows nothing of mathematics, science, or even the English language he has served for years as a valued employee her at Beem.
