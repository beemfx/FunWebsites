## Michael Henrikson
### Web Development
"http colon slash slash www dot"

The one and only the man behind much of the web development.  He has spent many impatient hours sitting in front of a computer screen working on something he calls hypertext and java (I could go for a cup right now).

He grew up in the small Kentucky town of Farville.  “A place that’s just not worth living,” he calls it.  His parents were divorced at a very young age, and his father left town to have a sex change operation.  Perhaps this is why he has chosen his lifestyle.  His gay lifestyle that is.  But don’t tell him I wrote that, he tries to keep it a secret.  What the hell am I thinking he probably is going to post this on the site so he’ll see it anyway.  I wonder if he’ll change it.

We don’t really know why he has stayed at Beem so long.  He has been made fun of more than Kevin Decker’s Mama’s Ass.  We could always hire another web developer.  Maybe he has trouble finder work with his lifestyle.  Beem has never been one to discriminate.  At least not during the hiring process.

<small>Beem has nothing against those that choose the homosexual lifestyle.  But most of the men here do admit that we prefer the look of a sexy woman to any man at all.</small>
