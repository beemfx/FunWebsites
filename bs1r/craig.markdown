## Craig Decker
### VIP
"When I play the trumpet I’m free"

Some Beem employees don’t agree that Craig deserves a spot as a VIP, but anything President says goes.  Craig is the true man behinds Beem success.

Why does all this credit go to a man who hasn’t touched a computer in years.  Simple.  He is the man that introduced Programming to our beloved president.

Craig enjoys partying with his friends going out and hanging with people of IQ’s exceed 170.  While many would believe Craig resides as an average man of society.  Others would agreed his fame an fortune is only an apple a day away.
