<h2>About Beem</h2>
Beem Software was founded in 1997 under the name of <b>B.M. Software</b>.  Almost as soon as teh company was founded we developed Castle version 1.00 which would advance to castle 1.4 in the subsequent months.  At that point we continued our software development with Joes Copter.  Following the success of Joes Copter we began development of it’s sequel Joes Copter 2:  The Revenge, as well as the popular title Explor: A New World.
<p>
Joes Copter 2 beta hit the market big with a good look for the future.  However, sadly, most of our development team quit.  We were forced to shut down the project, permanently.  Almost all functions of Beem were put off for years.
<p>
Then in November of 1999 B.M. was back on it’s feet.  Financially anyway.  We upgraded most of our lab’s and equipment.  Within a few months we continued the development of our trashed project Explor.  We developed an entirely new system for our company and were pouring out titles by the year.  Explor Beta was completed in the first quarter of 2000.  The public loved it.  B.M. was ready for the future.
<p>
In the last quarter of 2000 we changed our name to <b>Beem Software™</b>.  
<p>
After hundreds of man-hours we finally released Castle: A Text Based Adventure version 3.00.  With the all new technology Castle hit the market big.  With popularity from ages young to old.
<p>
Beem has continued it’s project development with plans to complete Explor: A New World.  Beem hopes to continue to develop great new software titles into the 21st Century.

<h2>People</h2>
<h3>Blaine Myers</h3>
The truth is that Beem Software is a one man show, we don't have the funding to get anyone else to work for us, that is why we haven't actually released any profitable software titles.  Blaine Myers is however a talented computer programmer, unfortunatebly he is not an artist, level designer, modeller, sound engineer, or anything but a programmer.  Despite the fact that Beem can develop effective technology, there is no one else to build the games that use the technology built.
<h3>Deckard</h3>
Deckard has contributed a small amount of work to Beem Software, unfortunately not enough for us to really get anywhere.
