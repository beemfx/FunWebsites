================================================================================
fun.beemsoft.net is a bunch of random websites that I made for fun over the
years (especially in the 90s). I wouldn't say any of them are particularly
interesting, but here's a few notes on some of them:

beemsoft1: This is Beem Media's first website. I think it was first hosted on
geocities and then later on my ISPs personal web server. Pretty much everything
on it was made up as none of the employees are real. The About "history" page is
mostly made up. The products are actually things I built or planned on building.

beemsoft2: This is Beem Media's second website. I went a bit more simple on this
because I didn't see the point in putting a bunch of stuff I made up on it.
This time around I wrote an actaul history (though it grosely exagerates "our
success" and "populatity" being that we never released anything until 2021 when
EXPLOR actually came out).

flashmovies: These are some movies I made in Flash. They are fairly offensive. ISPs
still find them funny, but I'm not proud of them. They don't really work on modern
browsers now that Flash isn't really supported.

jupiter: This one has the most history, and was the most useful. The history is
that I saw my friends making what I thought were stupid "about me" pages, and I
thought that no one on the internet would give a flip about some random person's
about me page, and I had this friend that was doing a report on the planet
Jupiter and it occured to me that if a website should be made it should be made
about something useful. So I made a website about the planet Jupiter. I was maybe
14 years old so I didn't know anything about Jupiter so all I did was copy the
Encarta '95 article on it then add an FAQ to it. The website existed for years
on Geocities. Then one day some random person emailed me and basically said, "I
see what you did there." Then I was worried Microsoft might find out and sue me,
so I took it down immediatley. In it's current form I removed all the copyright
material, but you can see how the outline lines up with the Encarta article.
Incidently I was on the right track. If I had thought more broadly this could have
been Wikipidea and I'd be a millionaire. Among the other issues with the website
is that I used frames. Who uses frames? I did.

mandm: I am a huge Might and Magic fan and so I made a website about it. Most of the
information is based on my interpretation of the games, which is incorrect compared
to Celestial Havens for example, but right before 3DO went out of business I was
listed on their website as one of the fan sites. The funniest part is I'd get people
emailing me asking me how to get the games working on modern computers and I would
respond to them and help them as best as I could.

moved: A website I made that supposedly redirects the browser. It wouldn't work on
modern browsers though.

otherweb: Some funny things I made up for fun.

solution: This is the solution to a puzzle. I don't really think my explanation is
Mathematically rigorous, but it is reasonable.

titanic: This website was a class project. Basically my high school offered a
"programming" class, but no teachers knew anything about programming except one guy
that was at least willing to teach HTML. I already knew HTML and was learning C by
that point so the class was a complete waste of time, but in my mind, a slider class
was what I wanted so I stayed in the class. I decided to make a Titanic website
because everyone hated on Titanic and I thought it was funny to be a contrarian and
say it was my favorite movie.
