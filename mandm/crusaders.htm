<h2>About Crusaders of Might and Magic:</h2>
Drake has lost his family and his home.  All he thinks of is revenge.  After years of training in the skills of Might and Magic he is ready to take on Necros, Lord of the Dead.  Only the Legion of the Fallen stands in his path.

<h2>Overview</h2>
Crusaders of Might and Magic is the first completely 3D Might and Magic Adventure. The game is very fun and very quick-two days to complete it.  It's not your regular RPG Might and Magic but and Action Might and Magic.  It still has some RPG aspects but really not much. 
<p>
I don't really think the game was completed, at least not the ending.  There is only one video, at the very beggining, I would expect another for the ending sequence, but no.
<p>
The game is very fun, shamelessly addicting.  It's very easy to master and very fun.  Combat is relatively easy once you learn how to use a shield efectively. 
<p>
I'd like to mention that Crusaders was not created by New World Computing, but 3DO.  The story does not seem to be connected to the Might and Magic series but the Mandate of heaven is mentioned.  I don't really like to think of it as part of the Might and Magic world but it is very fun so I really recommend it.
<h1>General Strategy</h1>
In order to fight effectively: Hold your sheild ready, wait for the enemies strike (you'll block it with your readied sheild), then retaliate with brute force.
