<b>General:</b> On most newer systems you will probably encounter audio errors during the dialog at the begining of the game.  You should skip the intro by pressing the escape key.   The same thing will happen at the end of the game, but you can't skip it.  You should not use MO'SLO or any other processor dampening program as these cause undesirable results.
<p>
<b>Memory:</b> Requires 565K of conventional memory and 2048K of extended (XMS) memory.  (See "Memory Configuration" below.)
<p>
<b>XP:</B> In the configuration program select "PC Speaker" for sound.

Memory Configuration
</th></tr>
<tr><td bgcolor=white>
In the root directory of you file system (Usually C:\) find the file called "config.sys" open this file with a text editor and make sure the following two lines appear within it:
<p>
<font face="Courier" size=1>
DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\HIMEM.SYS<br>
DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\EMM386.EXE ON RAM 4096
</font>
<p>
Where C:\WINDOWS represents the directory where windows is installed.<br>
<b>Note</b> that after modifying "config.sys" you must restart your computer for the settings to take effect.
<p>
To change memory settings for any given application go to the directory where the application is installed.  Right click on the application, click properties, click the memory tab.  Modify the settings as required.

VDMSound

The exists such an application, <a href=http://ntvdm.cjb.net/>VDMSound</a>, that will allow SoundBlaster emulation in a Windows NT environment (specifically Windows 2000 and Windows XP).  It also resolves memory issues in a Windows NT environment.  VMDSound is for DOS applications.
<p>
From the <a href=http://ntvdm.cjb.net/>VDMSound Page</a> download the latest version.  Install it.  Then to run an application go to the directory where that application exists, right click on the application, and click "Run with VDMSound".  This should take care of any memory settings and sound support.  Note that application you are running should be configured to use a SoundBlaster with an IRQ of 5 or 7.
<p>
VDMSound works pretty well, but I can't garauntee that it will work for you.  For me it has worked with III, IV, V, "World of Xeen", and "Swords of Xeen"; but it will depend on your computer's configuration.
