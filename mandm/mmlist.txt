=== MIGHT AND MAGIC GAMES GUIDE ===
===================================

Copyright (C) 2004 Blaine Myers

=== INTRODUCTION ===
====================

With this guide I am attempting to document all releases of the various Might and Magic games.  Due to worldwide publishing I cannot possibly document every distribution of each game.  Instead I will attempt to detail each with known platforms, and significant distributions.  All US distributions were published by 3DO (since Might and Magic VI), in other countries the publisher varies and the given publisher was noted on the box.  For various countries the box text and art may have been slightly different, I do not consider these significant distributions.  When I document STANDARD PACKAGING this represents what was included with the US PC release of the games.  Note that the standard packaging usually included various advertising and disk exchange forms I will not mention those, but note that they may have been included.

I believe the original games were published for the Apple II format.  Because I don't know much about the history of Apple Computers I can't be sure of each individual release.  I am not documenting the various clue books and strategy guides that were available for each of the games, but note that I, II, III, IV, and V had a cluebook available published by New World Computing.  Various strategy guides have been published for the rest of the games.

This list list is not organized by release date.  It is listed by series in the following order: Might and Magic Series, Might and Magic Series Compilations, Heroes of Might and Magic Series, Heroes Chronicles Series, Heroes of Might and Magic Series Compilations, Other Might and Magic Games.  The games are generally presented in the order in which they take place (ie. Might and Magic II before Might and Magic III), but this will not always be the case.

PLATFORM CODES:
PC (DOS): PC running MS-DOS operating system.
PC (WIN): PC running 32-BIT Windows(tm) operating system.
PC (WIN/DOS): PC.
Apple II: Apple II computer.
Commodore 64/128: Commodore's 64K and 128K computer systems.
PC Engine: PC Engine System.
AMIGA: Amiga System (???).
TURBO GRAPHICS CD: ???
MAC: Computer running Apple's Macintosh operating system.
NES: Nintendo Entertainment System.
SNES: Super NES.
SFC: Super Famicom, Japanese SNES.
GENESIS: Sega Genesis/Megadrive.
PS: Playstation.
PS2: Playstation 2.


Note that some PC (WIN) operating systems are capable of running PC (DOS) games.  I also believe that MAC operating systems are capable of running Apple II games (???).

PC (WIN/DOS) generally means the game uses a windows based installer, but requires DOS compatibility to run the games.

=== MIGHT AND MAGIC SERIES ===
==============================

------------------------------
--- MIGHT AND MAGIC BOOK I ---
------------------------------

COMPLETE TITLE: Might and Magic Book One: Secret of the Inner Sanctum
ORIGINAL RELEASE: 1986
STANDARD PACKAGING: Disks (3 1/2 OR 5 1/4); Manual; Map; Installation Guide; Grid Paper
AVAILABLE PLATFORMS: PC (DOS); Apple II; Commodore 64/128; PC Engine; MAC, NES.
SIGNIFICANT DISTRIBUTIONS:

	NES: The nintendo distribution features much better graphics, a much stronger soundtrack (background music, SFX, etc.).  The control interface is different (gamepad).  The combat system does not have the same rules as the computer versions.  The maps are generally the same, and all the quests are the same.  Converted to the NES by Sammy.

-------------------------------
--- MIGHT AND MAGIC BOOK II ---
-------------------------------

COMPLETE TITLE: Might and Magic Book Two: Gates to Another World
ORIGINAL RELEASE: 1988
STANDARD PACKAGING: Disks (3 1/2 OR 5 1/4); Manual; Map; Installation Guide.
AVAILABLE PLATFORMS: PC (DOS); Apple II; Commodore 64/128; PC Engine; MAC; AMIGA; SNES; GENESIS.
SIGNIFICANT DISTRIBUTIONS:

	SFC (Japanese): The japanese release is a fascinating release of Might and Magic II.  The maps and quests are all the same.  The graphics are very impressive (there is an animated sky).  The background music has a very japanese feel to it.  You could only have five members in your party at a time, but they had Anime-style portraits.

	GENESIS: Same maps and quests.  Background music, SFX.  Combat system is used differently, but the rules are pretty much the same.

	SNES (European): Based off the same engine as the GENESIS release, but the graphics are updated to look significantly better.

---------------------------
--- MIGHT AND MAGIC III ---
---------------------------

COMPLETE TITLE: Might and Magic III: Isles of Terra
ORIGINAL RELEASE: 1991
STANDARD PACKAGING: Disks (3 1/2 OR 5 1/4); Manual; Map; Reference Card; Notepad.
AVAILABLE PLATFORMS: PC (DOS); AMIGA; MAC; GENESIS; TURBO GRAPHICS CD; SNES.
SIGNIFICANT DISTRIBUTIONS:

	SNES, GENESIS: These releases are pretty much exactly the same game except they use a gamepad.  I'm actually not sure if there was a Genesis release, but there are ROM's on the NET that had to be dumped from somewhere.  The graphcis are the same (except they look worse than they do on the PC), the music is different.

========================
=== Collecting Guide ===
========================

If you’re looking to obtain each game it is really quite simple. As of now (January 2004) you can generally find a copy of "Might and Magic VI Special Edition" for $10 to $30 this includes Might and Magic I-VI and Swords of Xeen.  Might and Magic VI-IX can be purchased with the "Might and Magic Platinum" collection.

You may also want the "World of Xeen CD-ROM" which is available in the "Might and Magic Millennium Edition" package and as a standalone product.

As 3DO has gone bankrupt all "Might and Magic" and "Heroes of Might and Magic" titles are becoming more and more difficult to obtain.

Originally copies of I-V are fairly rare, the newer titles are starting to become rare.  The titles will occaisionally show up on ebay and usually you can get a good price for them (under $10.00), but it depends on how many people are looking.
