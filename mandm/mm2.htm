<h1>About Book II</h1>
The Elemental Lords fight an ongoing war against the very mortals they beleived too weak to have power.  The King was destroyed in a mighty fight amongst the elementals.  Demons scour the mountains and hills of CRON.  Only a small group of adventurers can build up the courage to defeat the darkness of these times.

<h1>Overview</h1>
Gates to Another World is a very fun game.  It has some major improvements over it's prequil.  Although the game is very similar to Secret of the Inner Sanctum, you'll notice a few things that really improve the entertainment of this title.
<p>
The biggest improvement, the thing that really made the game easier to handle, and less annoying is the automap.  The game saves every square you walk upon no more wondering where you are.  There is no longer a need for the location spell, I don't even know why they put it in the game(I guess if you don't have the automap or are in a magical dungeon).  
<p>
The biggest improvement, visually, is animation.  Almost everything you encounter is animated.  The torches on the walls, every friend or foe, and then some.  Since we're discussing the visual effect I'd also like to add that there is a sky and it looks different from night to day. :)
<p>
<h1>General Strategy</h2>
Exploring this game to it's fullest is rather easy because with the automap you don't have to spend hours writing down your own maps.  I explored every square in the game and was able to complete the entire game within two weaks.
<p>
To gain the most experience, exploring the dragon cave in the north eastern region is very helpful.  Just walking on a few squares will get you dozens of encounters with the toughest monsters known as dragons.  Each battle with a dragon will give you a lot of experience and cash.
<p>
A little advice for beginners: Don't always use the same party members.  Each class has to complete a quest, with only members of that class int the party.  So have at least three of each type of character at at least level 20.
<p>
Level 40-50 should be enough to complete the game.
