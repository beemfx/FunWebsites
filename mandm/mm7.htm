    <h2>About For Blood and Honor</h2>
    Engage in an adventure dealing with powers beyond any others. Will the forces of Darkness reign with a blood stained sword. Or the power of light bring honor to the land of Erathia. Only a party of adventurers can decide the fate of Erathia.

        <h2>Overview:</h2>
        For Blood and Honor is the follow up of The Mandate of Heaven. Gameplay is very similar except that now you may have other races in your party such as Elf, Dwarf, or Goblin as well as Human. VII: Focuses more (than VI) on the story at hand.

            There is a major problem with the game. About half way through you be at a level too tough to bother with anything weak, and too weak to handle the tougher quests. This time will end after much struggle, but it's almost not worth it too continue.

                The graphics have been improved by using Direct3D extensions. This adds to the enjoyment found in the previous title.

                    In this Might and Magic Title about a quarter of the way through the game you will be permitted to choose between two sides. The side of Light or Darkness. Both paths will be similar in quests. Which will you decide to choose. It all depends on who you
                    are. You may even choose to play both sides.
                    <p>
                        VII allows a lot more character classes than the previous title. You can choose new classes like the druids, rangers, and monks.

                            Of particular note Might and Magic establishes a connection between the 'New Age' and the other two 'ages' by mentioning characters and locations in the previous titles. I was satisfied to discover this.
                            <h1>General Strategy</h1>
                            Unlike previous MM titles this game is driven by completing quests. Fighting a lot of monsters will give you experience, but not that much. Instead completing quests gives you the most experince. Usually one quest completed will give you enough experince
                            to update you level by one. Fighting monsters takes forever to gain levels. If your stuck in a rutt and aren't tough enough to complete any mandatory quests try to find a quest you can complete with little difficulty.
                            <h1>Extensive Strategy</h1>
                            Try here to fight for Blood without Honor (no honor because you can't take on the evil (or good) alone):
