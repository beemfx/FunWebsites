    <h2>About The Mandate of Heaven:</h2>
    The Succession wars have ended but there is still a darkness in the Land of Enroth. A Mysterious army of demons has appeared in the lands to the west. The Righteous King Roland has dissapeared, and few are willing to battle against the greatest evil in
    these dark times. Can the Mandate of Heaven save Enroth.

        <h2>Overview:</h2>
        The Mandate of Heaven begins the 'New Age' of the Might and Magic series. While the 'Dark Age' and 'Renaissance' were actually very similar ages you'll notice that this 'New Age' is a lot more advanced.
        <p>
            Might and Magic VI is the first Might and Magic game to be in rotaional 3D perspective. That means you can rotate and face 360&trade; of direction.
            <p>
                One downside to Might and Magic VI is that you may only have humans in you're party, and you only get four characters. The other downside is the background music; the game uses CD audio for the background music, and it only plays through the current area's
                track once then stops, after that there is almost no sound. Other than that everything is Hunky Dorey.
                <p>
                    While you could win Might and Magic I - V very quickly---a week per game---you'll find that Might and Magic VI takes much longer. In part because enemys take longer to die. But mostly because walking around takes a lot longer than in VI's prequils.
                    <h1>General Strategy</h1>
                    Fight a lot of monsters. If a dungeon is tuff enough that you have to escape a lot rest then head back in, avoid that dungeon untill you gain a few more levels.
                    <p>
                        Doing quests gives a lot of experience.
