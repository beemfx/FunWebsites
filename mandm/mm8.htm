<h2>About Day of the Destroyer</h2>
In accord with the prophecies, the Destroyer once again roams the land of Jadame.  Only by doing something, then doing something else, and going inside a crystal and then uniting the elements (I don't remember the game too well and I'm bored of writing these intros.) can a group of heroes save the land.

<h2>Overview:</h2>
Day of the Destroyer is pretty much like MM6 and MM7, enginewise that is, the actual gameplay is slightly different.  Instead of creating each character of your party, you create only one.  This, however, doesn't not stop you from having up to five characters in your party.  I must admit that I didn't really like this fact, as I have always enjoyed <a href="mmpchars.htm">creating and naming characters</a>.  One thing I did like was that you could switch up the characters in your party (like back in the old days, pre MM6).
<p>
If you enjoyed MM7 or MM8 you'll probably like this one as well.  Sadly that darn thing where the music tracks play only once is still there.  But other than that it's a pretty good game.

One thing that I really didn't like was that when you upgrade Necromancers to form liches they turn into these ugly skeletons (which is sad because the sexiest character in my party was a necromancer, and I sure didn't want here pretty face to replaced by a skeleton, too make a long story short, I never did upgrade that particular necromancer.)
