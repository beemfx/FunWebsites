Guide to Collecting:

 

If you’re looking to obtain each game it is really quite simple.  Might and Magic I-V can be obtained through Interplay’s: The Ultimate Might and Magic archive.  This archive is out of print, but you can generally find a copy on Ebay for around $15.

 

Might and Magic VI and VII can be found in most computer game retailers.  To make things easier you can purchase Might and Magic Millennium Edition which contains MM IV-VII.  Might and Magic IV and V are included as the World of Xeen 2 CD set with a voice track (so even if you have these two it’s still worth it to get Millenium).

 

Might and Magic VIII is currently only available in it’s original retail package.

 

All Might and Magic games are available at the 3DO store online.  However Might and Magic I and II are only available there as a download.  Might and Magic III can be purchased with the Might and Magic Trilogy (MM III-V), but it would be more practical to find a copy of Interplay’s compilation. (Note: Actually I'm under the impression that this option is no longer available at the 3DO store.)

 

Original copy’s of Might and Magic I-V are long out of print.  However it is possible to obtain them.  Ebay is probably your best bet for that.  Might and Magic III-V can almost always be found on Ebay, they go for $10-$30.  MM I and II are extremely rare.  I’ve seen a sealed copy of MMI go for over $70.
