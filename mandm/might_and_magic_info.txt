Please do not redistribute for profit without my consent.  This took 
time to write and would have taken more without a lot of experience 
parsing Apple disk data.  However, if you contact me with a *SPECIFIC* 
query to post this FAQ on your site I will, after performing a certain 
amount of research, probably be in an agreeable mood.

This document does reveal the special abilities(not including puzzles) 
of every item in the game, so there is a potential for spoiling aside 
from walkthroughs.  As MM1 doesn't tell you these things 
specifically(well, there's a lot it doesn't tell you, which adds to the 
challenge in some ways,) perhaps people who still enjoy poking around in 
this game(or who wondered about certain things in the game) will enjoy 
this chart.

World's and this document is intended as analysis.  If any relevant 
parties wish me to take down this document I have no problem with it.

FAQ stuff

  This is woefully underdeveloped right now.  The only info currently 
here is:
  QUICK START:  Get one character with each trait.  It helps if they are 
all women(see Portsmith) but as that is later in the game and not really 
necessary(and can be switched!) don't worry about it too much.
  To get the best possible non-magic items, I recommend that you create 
a bunch of characters that will get deleted--but first rip off the 200 
gold each one gets!  Plate mail for all who can....
  DRAGONS: who breathes what?
BLACK-ACID
BLUE-LIGHTNING
GOLD-ENERGY
GRAY-SPIKES
GREEN-POISON
RED-FIRE
SILVER-ENERGY
WHITE-COLD

ITEMS(all 256 including "Useless item" which occurs when a person uses 
an unequippable item and its charges run out)

The reason so much of the charts is in ALL CAPS is because I derived the 
info.
directly from byte codes on the disk.  Future versions may be able to 
modify
this with a stub function, but for now I just wanted to be able to get 
it out
there--when I do so, I'm more motivated to update/revise.  I suspect the 
current version is more than functional enough.

Here's a rough key:  "Used by" contains class abbreviations, R for 
robber, S
for sorceror, C for cleric, A for archer, P for paladin, and K for 
knight.  E/G
denotes which alignment can use it.  "EG" means that neutrals can use 
it, too.

SPECIAL determines if the item has special features, increases 
protection or
attributes.  EQUIP means it can be equipped, NONE means it can't be, and 
anything else means it is equippable and either provides protection 
against something or adds to an attribute.
AMT says how much those attributes are increased by.  For instance, 
COLD/50 increases cold resistance by 50 per cent.
MAGIC indicates if the item can cast magic spells--if so, the number of 
charges is indicated.
COST means the cost in gold.
DMG gives the item's maximum base damage.  This is only relevant for 
weapons.  A club, for instance, would do 1-3 damage, notwithstanding 
calculations regarding the character's might.
AC/DMG tells of the armor class bonus to the character if the item is 
armor, or extra damage added to DMG.  For instance, a spear +1 would do 
1-6 damage PLUS 1.

General observations:  a lot of these items have arbitrary evil/good 
alignments, and the cursed "Bracers AC 8" and "Large Shield +2" are 
nasty tricks, although some of the other cursed items are funny.  In 
Might and Magic II, the magic pluses were not part of the item, which 
made the item list more flexible and allowed for more items(Chain Mail 
+1 and Chain Mail have the same item number in the sequel.)  Also, the 
extra attributes added by magic items are arbitrary.  And some items 
which are useless for combat and spell purpose are critical to solve the 
game.

Note that many columns do not apply for many items.

SPELLS

There are two spell classes in the game, Cleric and Sorcerer.  Each one 
has seven spell levels, attainable at experience level 2x-1(i.e. spell 
level 5 is achieved at level 9).  Also, Paladins and Archers may attain 
Cleric and Sorcerer spells, respectively, up to level 4.  They gain 
spell knowledge at experience level 2x+5.  All spells are automatically 
learned on achieving the new level.

The spell cost equals the spell level, except in cases I have noted 
where the cost is equal to the spellcaster's level.

I have tried to indicate how useful spells are.  For damage spells, the 
effectiveness depends on the type of monster.  For incstance A fire 
spell will be more effective on a Red Dragon(fire breathing) than a 
White Dragon(frost breathing.)

Note:  monsters can cast these spells on you, too.

The following list of spells is cut and pasted, with generous 
permission, from project64.c64.org.

QUICK WALKTHROUGH[NECESSARY STUFF]







As this is a bit of a spoiler, I threw in a few carriage returns before 
going on with it.  This contains only the quests needed to get to the 
end of the game.  It doesn't tell how to improve your characters so that 
they can win certain critical fights.  It just tells the items and where 
to get them.

I.   FIVE TOWNS QUEST
  A.  Sorpigal (1,2) dungeon under, get scroll--from entrance go west, 
north, west.
  B.  Erliquin (3,4) behind inn, say "N" when asked to sign in, go 
forward to see Agar.  +500 Exp.
  C.  Dusk (8,0) in maze,  SWSSESSSS from the entry gets you to 
Telgoran.  +1000 Exp, +500 gold.
  D.  See Zam in Portsmith (12,2)--here the jump or teleport spells will 
be useful.  If your characters are male be sure to rest after passing 
through intersections.  From the entry (1,15) you can go SSSSS jump 
SSSSSE rest EE jump EE jump ESSSENN.
  E.  See Zom in Algary (1,1) west from the inn, south through the 
docks, all the way west, 1n, 1e.
  F.  Go to C-1 (15,15) to find treasure including a ruby whistle.  It 
won't be there unless you've gotten the twins' clues.
II.  DIAMOND KEY
  A.  Go to B1(4,4) and answer "love" to get the bronze key.
  B.  Do it again to get the diamond key.  From Erliquin you can go 
WSWWWSSSWWWSSW[secret door in mountain]SSWSSSSESSWWNE.
III. GOLD KEY
  A.  Go to the Minotaur's stronghold.  From (15,8) go SSSSWWWWSEEE and 
blow the whistle twice as previously instructed(the game will prompt you 
to blow the whistle 0-9 times.)
  B.  Go west to an intersection, north, and west.  Descend at (1,12).  
Go west, south through the door, and go to the grate east at (1,4).  
Follow the spiral and don't desecrate the doggie.  Search for the gold 
key.
IV.  CORAL KEY
  A.  Go to the one-eyed gypsy at C2 (9,11) and learn each player's 
sign.
  B.  Fly to A4 and you will be at (14,14).  Go 9W, 6S.  
WSEE(encounter)SWW will get you to a place where you are asked your 
signs.  If you do well you are teleported to (4,2) where you will search 
and find the coral key.
V.   KEY CARD
  A.  South from (7,13) you'll find the Volcano God's island.  The Coral 
Key should fit in the slab.
  B.  The virgin at (5,0) will tell you where to set the stabilization 
dials if you kiss her(release her, and the Volcano God fights you.  He's 
tough.)
  C.  (6,3) at stabilization dial 1, type B.
  D.  (8,3) at stabilization dial 2, type J.
  E.  Teleport at (6,0)--you will go to (11,7).
  F.  Ask the Volcano God for a riddle(a clue first is OK too--it tells 
you about the Og quest.)  "Who was brave but failed?"  GALA (remember 
the statues in Sorpigal!)
  G.  Search to get the key card.
VI.  Rescue King Alamar
  A.  Enter Doom at (7,14) by the secret passage.  The "quick way" is to 
fly to A1 and go north, etherealize, and follow the passage to the 
north.  It avoids automatic encounters on some squares, too.
  B.  Teleports are at (8,5) (6,6) and (7,10).  Jump over them.
  C.  The gold door is at (7,7) so you need the gold key.  At (7,8) you 
will get the Eye of Goros to confront the false Alamar.
VII. Destroy false Alamar
  A.  Go to C1(5,7) and search to get Merchants Pass.  It's not strictly 
necessary but easier than going to Ranalou's and teleporting to Castle 
Alamar and etherealizing.
  B.  Go to A2(0,15) to get Kings Pass.  Etherealize may be your best 
bet if you can't find secret doors.
  C.  Go to E3(9,2) to find "password for today" from Heratio Harper.
  D.  Go to E3(12,6) and give the password to the lion.  NEE and you 
enter the castle.  From there go east until the false Alamar is 
revealed.
VIII.Soul Maze
  A.  The answer is in the orange walls in the maze: "My name is 
SHELTEM"
IX.  Astral Plane
  A.  Cast S7-1 to get there or go to the diamond door--E3(1,4) is an 
odd square, with ice surrounding it.  The door is one-way.
  B.  Visit the astral transporters in order.  Their coordinates are 
(4,6) (4,10) (7,14) (10,10) (10,6) and the Key Card to the Inner Sanctum 
is at (7,10).  Don't be shy about etherealizing, although mapping will 
also do the trick.
X.   Finale
  A.  Go to B1(4,15) for a message.  Congratulations, you've won!

SIDE QUESTS

Og's quest is one of the most inexplicable and incomprehensible I've 
ever seen.  However, I got a sense of accomplishment when I finally 
figured out why you were able to solve it, so here it is.  You need to 
find the white and black idols.  When you do, and you visit Og, he says 
"Queen to Queen's Level 4."  Your reply should be "Queen to King's Level 
1."
  A.  The Black Idol is at (0,15) in the Wizard's Lair level 1 B1 (13,5)
  B.  The White Idol is at (0,15) in the City of Gold level 4 E4 (10,5)
  C.  C3 (8,0) says the first part is female--the only female chess 
piece is the QUEEN.
  D.  Volcano God's dungeon (0,5) says the second part is the most 
valuable--the KING, the object of the game.
  E.  Dragadune level 2 E1 (12,12) at 20 feet below (9,13) says that the 
last part is the first--1.
  F.  You must respond in kind.  Slip the words "to" and "level" in to 
solve the quest.

CHEATS

In the fountains in C2, after drinking, go forward and you will be 
prompted to drink again.  This doesn't happen if you turn left and then 
right.  This way you can get stats of all 30 for one fight.  A useful 
way to start your party improving!

BUGS

If you get in combat and teleport/jump/flee you can still search for 
treasure.
The game never tells you if backpacks are full, but you can drop items 
and re-search.
